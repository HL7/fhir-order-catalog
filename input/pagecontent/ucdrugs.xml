	<p>This section lists the use cases for using catalogs of medications.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A health care organization maintains its medication formulary and shares it to the
			applications used by its physicians, nurses and pharmacists to support medication
			prescription, dispense and administration.</li>
		<li>A content vendor publishes the general catalog of medications authorized to a national
			market. Health care organizations of the country import subsets of this general catalog
			so as to synchronize their local medication formularies. </li>
		<li>Variant 1: In addition to the general catalog of medications, the content vendor hosts
			the medication formularies of each of its client organizations who interact with the
			server to use their own medication formulary in their medication workflows, as well as
			to maintain this medication formulary over time (inserting/updating/retiring items). </li>
		<li> A health care organization provides medication formularies to its patients for
			educational purposes. </li>
		<li>An organization exposes the set of standardized vocabularies needed to support full
			semantic interoperability for prescription, dispense and administration of medications
			within a jurisdiction (e.g. a country). This reference set is represented as a generic
			catalog of all the medications that are usable within the jurisdiction. This generic
			catalog is imported in whole or in parts by the applications of the prescribers, carers
			and dispensers of the jurisdiction. </li>
