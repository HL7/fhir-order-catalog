  <h3>Resources and Profiles for all devices</h3>
  <p>The figure below shows the resources and profiles used to represent catalogs of medical devices.

  <img src="DeviceCatalog.png" alt="Resources used by a catalog medical devices" width="1000px"/>
  <p>When method 1 is chosen by the custodian of the catalog of devices, the catalog
    references its items: the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/composition.html">Composition</a>
    resource constrained by the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/composition-catalog.html"> Catalog</a>
    profile to represent the whole catalog, references the items of this catalog from its
    Composition.section.entry elements.
  </p>
  <p>When method 2 is chosen instead, the catalog is referenced by its items: Each DeviceDefinition
    resource constrained by the <a href="StructureDefinition-DeviceModel.html"> DeviceModel</a> profile
	and representing an item of the catalog, references the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/composition.html">Composition</a> resource 
	constrained by the <a href="StructureDefinition-CatalogHeader.html"> CatalogHeader</a> profile to represent the header of the catalog header, which holds the general properties of the catalog.
  </p>
  <p>An item of the catalog describes a model or type of device, with its various identifiers, classifications, safety characteristics and properties, 
     instantiated as a <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/devicedefinition.html">DeviceDefinition resource</a>
	 linked to a number of supporting resources providing further details.
