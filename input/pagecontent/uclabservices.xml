	<p>This section lists the use cases for using catalogs of laboratory diagnostic services.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A clinical or pathology laboratory wishes to share its full compendium of diagnostic
			services with the healthcare professionals and organizations wishing to use these
			diagnostic services. It publishes it as a catalog of resources accessible online for
			discovery and retrieval. Consumers query the catalog online from their order entry
			application and retrieve the diagnostic services they want to insert into their orders to
			the laboratory for their patients. </li>
		<li> Variant 1: A consumer imports periodically the subset of the catalog it is interested
			in, so as to have it available locally in its computerized physician order entry
			application.</li>
		<li> Variant 2: The laboratory maintains its compendium of services in a proprietary format,
			and delegates the standard publication of this compendium to an external organization
			operating an HL7 FHIR server of such catalogs. The application maintaining the
			laboratory compendium interacts with the FHIR server to keep the publication up to date,
			inserting, updating or retiring services into/from the FHIR catalog. </li>
	</ul>
