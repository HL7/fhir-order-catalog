  <p>This page provides the detailed specifications for catalogs of laboratory diagnostic
    services.</p>
  <a name="LabServicesResourcesProfiles"> </a>
  <h3>Resources and Profiles</h3>
  <p> The figure below shows the resources and profiles used to represent catalogs of laboratory
    diagnostic services </p>
  <img src="LabCompendium.png" alt="Resources used by a laboratory service compendium" width="700px"/>
  <p>Catalogs of laboratory services use exclusively the <a
      href="StructureDefinition-CatalogHeader.html"> CatalogHeader profile </a> for the resource
    Composition. In other words, for binding a laboratory catalog to its items, only method 2 is
    usable, as depicted in <a href="index.html#technical"> Home Page - Technical overview</a> .
    Thus, the Composition resource holds only the general properties of the catalog and is
    referenced by the resources PlanDefinition constrained by the <a href="StructureDefinition-LabServiceDefinition.html"> 
    LabServiceDefinition</a> profile, which represent the items of the catalog. </p>
  <p>An item of the catalog is a laboratory service instantiated as a PlanDefinition, which
    represents either a test (type=test) or a panel (type=panel). A panel is a set of tests and/or
    panels. This PlanDefinition conveys the general properties of the item: identification, names
    and codings, orderability, applicability, jurisdictions, billing, status, possible replacement
    by another item, gender or species restrictions, goals, bibliographic references,
    citations and justifications, expected input documents (such as patient consent for genetic
    testing). The PlanDefinition contains a single occurrence of the element PlanDefinition.action. </p>
  <p>The PlanDefinition.action references one or more instances of ActivityDefinition constrained by
    the <a href="StructureDefinition-LabProcedureDefinition.html">LabProcedureDefinition profile,
    </a> each of which represents a laboratory procedure with its operational details, specifying in
    particular the specimens required to perform the test or panel, the input observations expected
    by the laboratory from the orderer, and the output observations that the procedure will
    produce.</p>
  <p>In most cases the PlanDefinition references a single ActivityDefinition, which represents the
    operational view of the service.</p>
  <p>In some cases the PlanDefinition of a lab service references multiple instances of
    ActivityDefinition representing multiple procedures assembled in logical groups with
    combinations of AND and OR. These logical combinations are used for example to indicate that the
    laboratory accepts multiple alternative specimens (e.g. venous blood versus capillary blood) to
    perform a test. They also allow to reuse existing panels within encompassing panels 
    (e.g. LOINC 49660-4 - HIV susceptibility panel by Genotype method, nesting 3 levels of panels and tests)</p>
  <p>Input and output observations of the service are defined as instances of ObservationDefinition 
    (<a href="StructureDefinition-InputObservationDefinition.html">InputObservationDefinition</a> for
    observations expected from the ordering clinician, and <a href="StructureDefinition-LabObservationDefinition.html">
      LabObservationDefinition</a> for observations produced by the lab service and reported back to the clinician), 
    with their quantitative (units, decimal precision, conversion factor, normal and therapeutic ranges) and/or 
    qualitative (authorized values, normal values, critical values, preferred report name) characteristics.</p>
  <p>Specimens required by the service are defined as instances of SpecimenDefinition conformant to the 
    <a href="StructureDefinition-LabSpecimenDefinition.html">LabSpecimenDefinition profile</a>, which enables to
    describe patient preparation requirements, collection procedures, types of containers to be used, 
    minimum volume needed, rejection criteria, retention time, handling requirements before testing. 
    An instance of SpecimenDefinition may specify one preferred testable specimen and multiple alternates, 
    each with its proper physical characteristics, handlings, requirements and rejection criteria. </p>

  <h3>Searching for Laboratory Services</h3>
  <a name="LabServicesSearchApproach"> </a>
  <h4>Searching Approaches</h4>
  <p> The key searcheable assets in a laboratory compendium are the laboratory services exposed to the consumers of the compendium. 
    Each laboratory service is represented by an instance of the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition.html">PlanDefinition</a> resource, 
    constrained by the <a href="StructureDefinition-LabServiceDefinition.html">LabServiceDefinition</a> profile. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two-step search: A client application browsing the content of the compendium may wish to first get the overview of a collection of services at first glance, 
        and then retrieve the full details associated with the services it is interested in (including specimens, input observations, lab results).
       In this case, the first query will perform a simple search on <i>PlanDefinition</i> with the desirable criteria listed in the table below ; 
        and then the second search will add the <b>_include:iterate=*</b> parameter, to retrieve the PlanDefiniton resource(s) associated 
        with all supporting resources (ActivityDefinition, ChargeItemDefinition, Composition, SpecimenDEfinition, ObservationDefinition ...) 
        in the <i>searchset Bundle</i>.</li>
      <li>One-step search: Conversely a client application may wish to retrieve the full details of a service at first glance. In this case, it uses the
        appropriate search criteria for PlanDefinition, in combination with the <b>_include:iterate=*</b> parameter, so as to obtain all the resources supporting
        each laboratory service which satisfies the criteria, assembled in the <i>searchset Bundle</i>.</li>
    </ul> 
  <p>Catalog servers may limit the iteration depth to an appropriate level for performance sake.</p>
