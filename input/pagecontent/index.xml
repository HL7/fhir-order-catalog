  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p> An order catalog exposes a homogeneous collection of healthcare items that can be ordered or
    selected by practitioners during the course of care delivery. These homogeneous healthcare items
    may represent services, products, devices or knowledge artifacts. Each item specifies its
    purpose, describes how it should be ordered and/or used, and characterizes the outcomes that one
    can expect from this usage. </p>
  <p> Examples include order sets catalog, evidence based CDS content, laboratory test compendium,
    medication formulary, catalog of medical devices. Order catalogs have varied scopes, sizes,
    ownerships and targetted consumers and jurisdictions. For instance an order catalog might expose
    the medical devices of a particular manufacturer to the potential users of these devices in a
    country. Another catalog might consolidate all the medical devices that are approved for use in
    healthcare throughout the Europe Union market. Another example of order catalog would be a drug
    formulary listing the medicinal products that are available for prescription in a particular
    hospital. A broader catalog of medicinal product might include all the medications authorized to
    the national market of a country. </p>
  <p> A catalog provides reference data, which aggregates requirements of usage for the items of the
    catalog, from multiple sources: regulatory, clinical knowledge, organizational (based on the
    organization of the provider of the items). </p>
  <p>Catalogs are meant to be used by IT systems and applications (e.g. EHR, EMR, CPOE, apps, LIS,
    Pharmacy system ...) as well as by humans. Humans interact with catalogs through the mediation
    of their applications.</p>
  <p>Client applications may interact with a catalog to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>browse through entries of the catalog and retrieve items of interest together with the
      detailed instructions and guidance related to the usage of these items,</li>
    <li>import/export the full catalog or a part of it (e.g. import the recent updates), </li>
    <li>administer the content of the catalog: add/update/retire items and/or supporting resources.
    </li>
  </ul>
